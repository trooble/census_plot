This is a barebones application to create plots from the Business Dynamics
Statistics data provided by the US Census Bureau.

Installation

The directory demo1 is the Django application. Edit the file
demo1/demo1/settings.py to set the proper values for DATABASE.NAME,
DATABASE.USER, DATABASE.PASSWORD and TEMPLATE_DIRS.

The directory django_templates should be located wherever indicated by
TEMPLATE_DIRS.

The setup directory contains the scripts to load the data after running
'manage.py syncdb'. It also contains a WSGI script called 'django.wsgi' which
modifies the default Django wsgi.py according to the recommendations on the
WSGI site. See http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango .

Due to the differences between the Django development environment and the WSGI
environment, submission URLs in HTML forms need to be changed to match whatever
has been defined as the WSGIScriptAlias. I should automate this, but haven't
yet.

TODO: almost everything..
